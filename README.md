# Alberta-Dataset-Analysis
This project analyzes the Alberta Libraries dataset to understand funding sources, expenses, and user engagement trends. Using Power BI visualizations, we explore how libraries allocate resources, manage operations, and adapt to changing user needs. The insights help improve decision-making and enhance library services.

1. Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital age, data-driven decision-making helps public services like libraries optimize operations and improve user experiences. This project analyzes the Alberta Libraries dataset to gain insights into funding, resource allocation, and user engagement.

2. Data Source
The dataset is publicly available from Alberta.ca and contains financial, operational, and service metrics of libraries across the province.

3. Key Questions Addressed
How are Alberta libraries funded, and what are the primary revenue sources?
How is library expenditure distributed across different categories?
What trends exist in library membership and user engagement?
How efficient are different library systems in resource allocation?
4. Methodology
Data Processing: Cleaned and structured raw data for meaningful analysis.
Power BI Dashboard: Visualized financial and operational metrics.
KPIs & Metrics: Measured funding distribution, service efficiency, and user trends.
5. Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:

A pie chart illustrating library fund allocation (e.g., salaries, maintenance).
Trend analysis of membership participation and circulation data.
Revenue and expenditure breakdown for financial sustainability.
6. Key Findings
Funding Sources: Libraries rely heavily on local appropriations, with limited self-generated revenue.
Expenditure Trends: ~83% of library funds go toward daily operations.
User Trends: Increasing shift toward digital resources like e-books and online programs.
Operational Efficiency: Some libraries operate at lower costs while maintaining high service quality.
7. Conclusion
This project highlights how libraries can leverage data analytics to improve efficiency, optimize budgets, and enhance public services. By using data-driven insights, stakeholders can make informed decisions that benefit communities across Alberta.
